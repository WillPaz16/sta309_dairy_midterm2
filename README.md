# Analyzing Dairy Production and Consumption in Europe from 2009 to 2019

Author: Will Paz

## The Prompt:

In this problem, you will create a dashboard about dairy production and consumption around the world. The datasets for this problem come from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and have been preprocessed by OurWorldInData.org. You can read these directly into R through the following Github links:

  * Production: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oconnellmj/sta309/main/milk-production-tonnes.csv
  * Consumption: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oconnellmj/sta309/main/per-capita-milk-consumption.csv

Create a dashboard to study dairy production and consumption around the world. Among the plots, you must include the following:

  * A map of dairy production
  * A map of dairy consumption
  * Changes in dairy production/consumption over time
  * The relationship between dairy production and consumption
  * At least 4 plots in the dashboard

## The Response:

In response to the prompt, I decided to look at the dairy production in European Union for no particular reason at all. The maps that I created show both a heat map of the production of dairy in each specific country as well as a map that shows a heat map of the consumption of dairy per captia in each nation. In order to compare the prodction and consumption, I chose a simple ratio that represents the scaling factor of how much more diary is produced compare to consumed based on the consumption and production data per capita. And comparing that to the changes in production and consumption over time for each individual nation in the European Union can give you a good picture of how much we're overproducing dairy year after year.
